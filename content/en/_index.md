### Frontier Research

1.  **S2Q Teaches Multi-Agents to Keep Backup Plans.**
    S2Q (Successive Sub-value Q-learning) enables multi-agent systems to retain alternative strategies, addressing the common issue of **value decomposition** methods falling into suboptimal strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning. This new paper proposes learning multiple sub-value functions to preserve high-value alternative actions. Using a Softmax behavior policy, it encourages💡continuous exploration, allowing agents to [quickly adapt to changing optimal solutions (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17062).

    Taalas, founded by a dream team of ex-AMD execs, is directly challenging Nvidia with its 🔥**HC1 chip**, boasting a peak inference speed of 17,000 tokens per second. It's a whopping **10 times faster** than Cerebras and [costs only one-twentieth (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/02/381552.html). The core idea? Directly💡etching the model onto the silicon, making the chip the model itself. But this hard-coding approach has sparked controversy over obsolescence, leading to 🤦 polarized online reviews.

2.  **Karpathy Sparks Debate on "Claws" Resident AI Agents.**
    Karpathy's "Claw" concept—🔥**resident, schedulable AI agents** that run long-term, triggered by plans or events—has ignited a community debate. Is it safe to hand over passwords to a Claw 🤦? [Container sandboxes can't fundamentally eliminate risks (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47099160). Self-hosting is seen as a💡viable but pricey solution.
