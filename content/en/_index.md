### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **GLM-5 has dropped, and it's a total game-changer for domestic AI!** This bad boy isn't just a toy; it's the strongest domestic [open-source model (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-02-13-8) out there, with benchmark performance rivaling GPT-5.3. We're talking about a true **System Architect** here, folks! It handles complex tasks, zaps bugs automatically ⚡️, and its efficiency is absolutely mind-blowing. Devs were practically tripping over themselves to get their hands on it, causing servers to crash from the sheer demand! 🔥

2.  **Google's Gemini 3 Deep Thinker edition is smashing records left and right!** Led by Chinese scientist Yao Shunyu 🚀, its inference capabilities have [reached SOTA (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/02/379596.html). It scored a whopping 84.6% on ARC-AGI-2, leaving only 7 humans in its dust (seriously!). This powerhouse is built to tackle tough scientific and engineering challenges; it can even **design 3D-printed** models. With drastically reduced costs, its future applications are totally limitless! 🌈<br/>![AI News: Gemini 3 model-designed 3D-printed laptop stand](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/news_01khbq6f47ezbsv17088by742h.gif)<br/>

3.  **Xiaohongshu has dropped its strictest AI content management rules yet.** If you post synthetic content, it *must* have a clear label ⚠️, or your traffic will get [deducted (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/25515). They're cracking down hard on impersonating celebs and those demonic edits of classics 👹. To keep community trust high, algorithms 🕵️ will auto-detect suspicious AI. Creators, remember to ✅ declare your AI content when you hit publish!<br/>![AI News: Xiaohongshu App's AI content labeling interface](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/news_01khbq6ktpebat3dvr74r6rwa0.avif)<br/>

4.  **Hengdian World Studios just dropped its first AI-powered Chinese-style anime series on Tencent Video!** Named [Jiuzhou Muyun Lu (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/25533), it blends AI tech with classical Oriental aesthetics 🎨. Each episode clocks in at a snappy 2.5 minutes, perfect for our fast-paced lives ⚡. From special effects to storyboarding, AI was deeply involved in the **entire production chain**. This is a huge step for film and TV production, transforming it towards intelligent creation! 🎬<br/>

5.  **Thunderobot Technology is going all-in on the AI hardware market!** They're aiming for a whopping 50% overseas revenue 🎯, and their stock is climbing against the tide 📈. At CES, they showcased a bunch of [new AI terminal products (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/25529), from PCs to smart glasses 👓. They're driving growth by replacing older tech with AI, aiming to grab the **consumer market high ground**.

### Frontier Research

1.  **WorldArena, a new benchmark by Tsinghua and Peking Universities, is here to prove that strong vision doesn't automatically mean competence.** It's smashing the ["image quality only" theory (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-02-13-7) by focusing on physical consistency 🌍. Robots need to understand physics, not just generate pretty videos 🎥. Functional intelligence is just getting started, and this is like the **driving test** for embodied AI. You could ace the vision part and still flunk the task! 💡

2.  **The SToRM framework is bringing a new "slimming" solution to multimodal large models for autonomous driving.** It achieves [efficient token reduction (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11656), slashing computational costs by a whopping 30 times 📉. It maintains full token performance while also handling human instructions seamlessly 💡. By using sliding window prediction, it precisely retains **key information**, clearing the path 🧹 for vehicle-side deployment.

3.  **Context files for code Agents might actually be doing more harm than good!** A new study found that [AGENTS.md (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988) actually *decreases* task success rates ❌. All those redundant requirements hike up costs and make the models more easily confused 🤯. Experts suggest humans should only provide the **absolute minimum requirements**, with files just containing the 🔧 core logic.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Anthropic just closed a mind-blowing $30 billion funding round!** Its valuation has shot up to $380 billion, with Claude Code becoming its main [revenue engine (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2022138692991885716). Annualized revenue is soaring past $2.5 billion 🚀, and enterprise users 👥 are growing like crazy. They're all-in on a multi-cloud strategy, with **massive hardware expansion** underway. Get this: 4% of all global GitHub commits now come from 🤖 Claude!

2.  **OpenClaw has exposed tens of thousands of instances, revealing shocking security vulnerabilities!** Researchers found [numerous malicious skills (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r30nzv/d_we_scanned_18000_exposed_openclaw_instances_and/) capable of stealing data 🕵️, making it nearly impossible to defend against. Agent permissions are way too broad, like handing over the keys 🔑 to your entire digital life. With a lack of community oversight, the risk of supply chain attacks ⚠️ is only getting worse. Users, beware of 🔒 hosting risks!

3.  **Waymo's sixth-generation driver has sparked a massive debate about its technical approach.** It sticks to multi-modal sensing, using Lidar and visual [fusion perception (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46990578) 👀. The definition of "fully autonomous" is getting a lot of pushback ⚡. Does remote assistance count as **human intervention**? Data silos and regulation are becoming the biggest hurdles 🚧 for its real-world deployment.
