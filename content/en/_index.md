### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Pika launches AI Selves digital twins.**
    Pika's expanding beyond just videos, now💡 crafting "your second self." Users can upload a selfie and record some audio, and *boom*— [a digital twin is instantly born (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-02-21-4)! This twin boasts🔥**persistent memory and personality**, even remembering your peanut allergy (talk about attention to detail! 🤯). It can post, make calls, and stay active across various platforms for you. Currently, it's invite-only, so you'll need an invite code to get in on the action.

2.  **Replit Design Mode gets a massive upgrade.**
    Replit's Design Mode just got a massive upgrade! 🚀 The platform announced a complete overhaul, now powered by **Gemini 3.1** under the hood. Expect [sharper visuals and a smarter layout (AI News)](https://x.com/Replit/status/2024908080920887802). The official word? "Better taste too!" 😉 This means a seriously boosted experience for frontend developers.

3.  **Qwen3-Coder-Next API officially goes live.**
    The Qwen3-Coder-Next API is officially live! After Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen open-sourced Qwen3-Coder-Next, its [API is now available on Alibaba Cloud (AI News)](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2024877243072147689). It's also integrated into the💡**Coding Plan** solution. Dev teams can flexibly call the API, making it perfect for scenarios that demand🔥scalable endpoints. The official team is keen to hear your feedback!

4.  **Claude Code Desktop gets four major updates.**
    Claude Code Desktop just dropped four major updates! Anthropic has beefed up the desktop version with a🚀**server preview** feature, letting you see changes directly in the interface. They've also added local code review, so you can [get inline suggestions even before pushing (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2025018483210440984). PR monitoring now supports💡auto-fixes and auto-merges. Plus, conversations are fully cross-device, meaning seamless switching from CLI to desktop to mobile. Smooth sailing! ✨

### Frontier Research

1.  **S2Q teaches multi-agents to retain alternative strategies.**
    S2Q teaches multi-agents to keep alternative strategies handy. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, **value decomposition** methods often get stuck in sub-optimal strategies. A new paper introduces🔥Successive Sub-value Q-learning, which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain high-value alternative actions. This approach, based on Softmax behavior policy, encourages💡continuous exploration, allowing agents to [rapidly adapt to changing optimal solutions (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17062). Experiments show S2Q consistently outperforms others across multiple benchmarks. Impressive! 👏

2.  **MolmoSpaces builds a massive robot benchmark ecosystem.**
    MolmoSpaces is building a massive robot benchmark ecosystem! A new paper unveils🚀**over 230,000 indoor environments** and 130,000 labeled object assets. This supports various simulators like MuJoCo and Isaac, [covering all navigation and manipulation tasks (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11337). The sim-to-real correlation hits an impressive💡**R=0.96**. It's basically providing a scalable data and training foundation for robot learning research. Sweet! 😎

3.  **M-Attack-V2 smashes black-box visual large models.**
    M-Attack-V2 is smashing black-box visual large models! Addressing the challenge of black-box attacks on large vision-language models, researchers proposed🔥multi-crop alignment and auxiliary target alignment strategies. This boosted the attack success rate on Claude-4.0 from 8% to a whopping **30%**, and for [GPT-5, it even hit 100% (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645)! The method boasts a modular design💡, allowing for flexible stacking. And guess what? The code is already open-source! 🎉

### Industry Outlook & Societal Impact

1.  **Taalas' 24-person team directly challenges NVIDIA with new chip.**
    Taalas' 24-person team is directly challenging NVIDIA with their new chip! Founded by a dream team of former AMD executives, Taalas has unveiled its🔥**HC1 chip**, boasting a peak inference speed of 17,000 tokens per second. That's **10 times faster** than Cerebras, and it [costs only one-twentieth as much (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/02/381552.html)! The core idea is to directly💡etch the model into the silicon – essentially, the chip *is* the model. However, this "hardcoding" has sparked debate about obsolescence, leading to (as expected) mixed reviews online. 😬

2.  **Karpathy stirs controversy over "Claws" resident AI agents.**
    Karpathy is stirring up debate about "Claws" – resident AI agents. He introduced the concept of "Claw," which are🔥**resident, schedulable AI agents** designed to run long-term, triggered by schedules or events. The community is fiercely debating: Is it safe to hand over your passwords to a Claw? 😬 [Container sandboxes can't fundamentally eliminate risks (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47099160), critics argue. Self-hosting is seen as a💡viable but high-cost solution. Even the name and commercialization strategy have drawn some cultural snark.

3.  **Anthropic's Opus 4.6 vulnerability detection sparks controversy.**
    Anthropic's Opus 4.6 vulnerability detection is causing a stir. Anthropic claims Opus 4.6 uncovered about🔥**500 high-severity vulnerabilities**, vastly outstripping Google BigSleep's 20. The community is questioning the false positive rate and the definition of "high-severity," [demanding disclosure of the cost/vuln confusion matrix (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47091469). Others worry that💡low-barrier scanning might be abused to uncover open-source 0-days. The virtual security engineer route, however, seems to be a pragmatic consensus. 🛡️

4.  **Proliferation of AI side projects makes the community reflect.**
    The proliferation of AI side projects is making the community reflect. "Just write a prompt and get on Show HN" has become the💡new normal, with a flood of low-effort AI projects drowning out quality work. [The community is calling for adjustments to curation mechanisms (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47094637), with some suggesting a requirement to showcase🔥**workload and technical details**. However, others argue that AI lowers the barrier, empowering more people to build projects. Still, architectural risks and cognitive debt are factors that can't be ignored. 🤔

5.  **AI insider trading in prediction markets sparks ethical debates.**
    AI insider trading in prediction markets is sparking ethical debates. Someone is using AI on Polymarket to🔥identify insider trading and gain alpha. Supporters argue that insider bets can💡improve prediction accuracy, but [opponents frankly state that bribing employees for information is illegal (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47091557). While on-chain transactions are traceable, the advantage of copy trading can quickly be nullified by competition. Most ordinary users participate more out of a gambling mindset. 💸

6.  **Big tech AI products lose users quickly after massive investments.**
    Big tech AI products are seeing rapid user churn after massive investments. A major company's AI product poured💡billions into model training, marketing, and handing out red packets. On Chinese New Year's Eve, user numbers hit an🔥**all-time high**. Unfortunately, half were gone the next day 📉, and another half vanished the day after that. This [short-term profit-driven approach often leads to new teams inheriting the mess (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/699951ba60141db294585cb0), prompting deep reflection in the industry about long-term retention.

7.  **The truth behind declining AI customer service satisfaction.**
    The truth behind declining AI customer service satisfaction is out. Many companies have implemented AI customer service, leading to [customers feeling like they're being brushed off (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2025003573004681524). The right approach, it turns out, is to💡keep human agents on the front lines, backed by AI assistance. Customers don't just need🔥**professional answers**; they also need emotional support. 💖 AI should be a tool for human customer service, not a replacement.
