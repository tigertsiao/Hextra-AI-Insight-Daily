# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! This Privacy Policy is all about how we handle your info when you use our Service. It covers what we collect, how we use it, and when we might share it. Plus, we'll let you know about your privacy rights and how the law has your back. 😉

So, what's the deal with your personal data? We use it to make our Service awesome and even better! By hopping on board and using our Service, you're giving us the thumbs-up to collect and use your info as explained in this Privacy Policy. 👍

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Okay, let's get some clarity! 💡 Words that start with a capital letter have specific meanings, and you'll find those definitions right below. It doesn't matter if they're singular or plural – they mean the same thing!

### Definitions
Alright, for the sake of this Privacy Policy, here's what those terms mean:

- **Account** means your unique login setup that lets you dive into our Service, or specific parts of it. Think of it as your personal key! 🔑

- **Affiliate**? That's basically any company that either controls us, is controlled by us, or is chilling under common control with us. "Control" in this sense means owning 50% or more of the voting power (shares, equity, etc.) for electing directors or other management. Family business, kinda! 😉

- **Company** (that's us! 👋 You'll see us called "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole document) means **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies** are those tiny files a website tucks onto your computer, phone, or any other gadget. They're super handy for remembering things like your browsing history on that site, among other cool stuff! 🍪

- **Country**? For us, that means California, United States. 🇺🇸

- **Device** is any gadget you're using to tap into our Service – could be your computer, phone, or even a snazzy digital tablet! 💻📱

- **Personal Data** is simply any info that can point to you, an identified or identifiable person. Pretty straightforward! 👤

- **Service**? That's just another way of saying "our Website." 🌐

- **Service Provider** is basically anyone (an individual or a company) who helps us out by processing data for the Company. They're third-party folks we hire to keep the Service running smoothly, deliver parts of it, do Service-related tasks, or help us understand how you're using it. They're our trusty helpers! 🤝

- **Usage Data** is the info that gets collected automatically, like when you use the Service or from the Service's tech backbone itself. Think of it as data generated by your interactions, such as how long you hung out on a particular page. 📈

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: [https://ai.hubtoday.app/](https://ai.hubtoday.app/). Bookmark it! 📌

- **You**? That's the awesome person (or company, or legal entity) who's checking out or using our Service. It's all about you! ✨

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
So, about **Personal Data**... when you're using our Service, we might ask you for some bits of info that can help us get in touch or figure out who you are. This 'personally identifiable information' could be things like (but not limited to):

- Email address 📧
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Now, **Usage Data** – that's something we gather automatically the moment you start using our Service. It's like the service saying, 'Hey, how are things going?' without you lifting a finger! 😉

**Usage Data** can spill the beans on stuff like your device's Internet Protocol address (like its internet home address), what kind of browser you're using (and its version), which pages you've checked out, when you visited, how long you stayed, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic info. It helps us see how our Service is being used. 📊

If you're accessing the Service from your **mobile device**, we might automatically pick up some extra details. This includes (but isn't limited to) the type of phone or tablet you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the mobile browser you're using, and other diagnostic bits. We just want to make sure the mobile experience is top-notch! 📱✨

And hey, whether you're on a desktop or **accessing our Service via a mobile device**, we might also scoop up info that your browser sends our way. It's all part of making sure everything runs smoothly!

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
Alright, let's talk **Tracking Technologies and Cookies**! 🍪 We use these to keep an eye on what's happening on our Service and to stash away some info. We're talking beacons, tags, and scripts – they help us gather and track data, so we can continuously level up our Service and see what's working. Here's a peek at what we use:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: These are those little files that land on your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. But, just a heads-up: if you don't accept 'em, some parts of our Service might not work as intended. Most likely, our Service will use Cookies unless you've specifically told your browser to block 'em. Your call! 🤷‍♀️
- **Web Beacons**: You might spot tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs) tucked away in some parts of our Service and our emails. These little guys help us do things like count how many folks have visited a page or opened an email, and give us other cool website stats – like figuring out a section's popularity or making sure our systems are running smoothly. Think of them as silent surveyors! 🕵️‍♂️

So, **Cookies** come in two flavors: 'Persistent' and 'Session' Cookies. Persistent ones stick around on your computer or mobile device even after you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air the moment you close your browser. Poof! 💨

We actually use **both Session and Persistent Cookies** for a few good reasons, which we'll break down for you below: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Yours truly (that's us!)
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super crucial for making sure you can actually *use* the services on our Website and access all its cool features. They're like the security guards, helping verify who you are and keeping those pesky fraudulent account uses at bay. Without these, the services you're asking for just wouldn't fly, so we *only* use them to power those essentials for you. Phew! 🛡️

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us, again!
  - **Purpose**: These little gems simply remember if you've already given us the nod to use cookies on the Website. No need to ask you every single time! ✅

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Still us!
  - **Purpose**: These are the smart cookies! 🧠 They help us recall your choices as you navigate the Website, like keeping your login info handy or remembering your favorite language. The whole point is to give you a smoother, more personalized experience, so you don't have to input your preferences over and over again. Sweet!

Wanna know more about the cookies we use and what choices you have? No sweat! Just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section right here in our Privacy Policy. We've got all the details! 📖

### Use of Your Personal Data

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used, making sure everything's running like a dream! 🛠️

We won't spam you, promise! ✉️📞
- **To provide You with news**: We love sharing! We'll send you news, special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we offer – especially if they're similar to what you've already bought or shown interest in. Of course, you can always opt out if you're not feeling it. Your inbox, your rules! 🗞️✨
- **To manage Your requests**: Got a question or need something? We use your data to handle and manage whatever you throw our way! We're here to help. 🙋‍♀️
- **For business transfers**: In the event of something big like a merger, sale, restructuring, or if we ever need to transfer our assets (whether we're staying in business or going through something like bankruptcy), we might use your info to assess or facilitate that. Your Personal Data would be among the assets potentially transferred in such a scenario. Just so you know! 💼
- **For other purposes**: Yep, we might also use your info for other cool stuff like deep-diving into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promotions are hitting the mark, and generally making our Service, products, marketing, and *your* experience even better! We're always trying to improve. 🚀

So, when might **we share Your personal information**? Here are the scenarios: 🤝

- **With Service Providers**: We might team up with Service Providers and share your personal info with them. This helps us monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and yes, sometimes they might contact you on our behalf. They're part of our support crew! 🧑‍💻
- **For business transfers**: Should we ever get involved in a merger, sell off company assets, get financing, or have another company acquire parts of our business, your personal info might be shared or transferred during those negotiations or transactions. It's a standard part of business, folks! 💰
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates – you know, our parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or other companies we control or co-control. Don't worry, we make sure they're on board with this Privacy Policy too! They're part of the extended family! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With business partners**: Sometimes we team up with business partners to bring you awesome products, services, or promotions. In those cases, we might share your info with them. It's all about bringing you more value! 🎉
- **With other users**: Just a heads-up: if you're chatting it up or sharing personal info in public areas of our Service, everyone else might see it! And yep, it could even get shared publicly outside the Service. So, share wisely! 💬🌍
- **With Your consent**: Last but not least, if you give us the green light, we might disclose your personal info for any other purpose you agree to. You're in charge! ✅

### Retention of Your Personal Data
So, how long do **we keep Your Personal Data**? 🤔 We hold onto it only for as long as we absolutely need it to fulfill the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. This includes sticking to our legal duties (like if a law says we have to keep it!), sorting out any disagreements, and enforcing our agreements and policies. We're not hoarders, we promise!

We also hold onto **Usage Data** for our own internal analysis. Generally, this kind of data doesn't hang around for long. *However*, if it's helping us boost the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally required to keep it for longer, then it'll stick around a bit more. Safety and improvement first! 🔒✨

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
**Your information (yes, even your Personal Data!)** gets processed both at our main offices and wherever our processing partners are. What does that mean for you? It means your info might zip across borders and be stored on computers outside your home state, province, or country. Data protection laws can vary from place to place, so just a heads-up! ✈️🌎

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and sending us your info, you're essentially saying 'okay!' to that transfer. We appreciate your trust! 🙏

**The Company is committed to taking all reasonable steps** to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're absolutely sure they have solid controls in place, especially when it comes to keeping your info safe and sound. Your security is our priority! 🔒

### Deleting Your Personal Data
Good news! **You have the right to delete** – or ask for our help in deleting – the Personal Data we've collected about you. It's your data, after all! 💪

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right from inside the platform. Super convenient! ✨

**You're always in control to update, amend, or delete Your information!** Just log into your Account (if you have one, of course!) and head over to the account settings where you can manage your personal info. Or, if you prefer, just ping us, and we'll help you access, correct, or delete any personal information you've shared with us. We're here for ya! 🙋‍♂️

Just a quick note: we might need to hang onto certain bits of info if we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so. Thanks for understanding! 🙏

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
First up, **Business Transactions**! 💼 If our Company ever gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might be part of that transfer. But don't worry, we'll give you a heads-up *before* your data moves and falls under a new Privacy Policy. Transparency is key!

#### Law enforcement
Next, **Law enforcement**. 👮‍♀️ Sometimes, if the law demands it, or if public authorities like a court or government agency come knocking with a valid request, our Company might have to spill the beans and disclose your Personal Data. We gotta play by the rules!

#### Other legal requirements
And then there are **Other legal requirements**. Our Company might disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to: 👇

- Comply with a legal obligation ⚖️
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company 🛡️
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service 🕵️‍♀️
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public 🙏
- Protect against legal liability 🚫

### Security of Your Personal Data
**The security of Your Personal Data** is a big deal to us, truly! But let's be real: nothing transmitted over the internet or stored electronically is ever 100% bulletproof. We go all out using commercially accepted methods to guard your Personal Data, but we just can't give a rock-solid guarantee of absolute security. We're doing our best, though! 🤞

## Children's Privacy
Alright, a quick word on **Children's Privacy**! 👶 Our Service isn't made for anyone under 13. Seriously, we don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from kids under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your little one has given us Personal Data, please, *please* get in touch! If we discover we've collected data from a child under 13 without parental consent, we'll quickly wipe that info from our servers. Pinky promise! 🚫👦👧

And if we ever need to rely on your consent to process your info, and your country says 'get parental consent!', then we might just ask your parent's permission before we collect and use that data. We're all about doing things right! ✅

## Links to Other Websites
Heads up! Our Service might have **links to other websites** that aren't run by us. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We *highly* recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of every single website you visit. Better safe than sorry! 👀

Just remember, we can't control (and don't take responsibility for!) the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services out there. They're on their own! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
From time to time, we might give this **Privacy Policy a little update**. When we do, we'll let you know by simply posting the fresh new version right here on this page. Easy peasy! 🔄

Before any big changes kick in, we'll make sure to give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that 'Last Updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy, so you'll always know what's current! 📢📆

We recommend giving this Privacy Policy a quick check-in every now and then to catch any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy become official the moment they hit this page! 📚
