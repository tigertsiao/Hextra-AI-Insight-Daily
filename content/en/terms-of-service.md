# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before diving in, please carefully read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you agree to and accept these terms. ✨

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes awesome stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Heads up, some content is only for our subscribed members! 🚀

## 2. User Registration & Account
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account!** 🙅‍♀️
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis. You'll see the exact fees clearly stated on the checkout page. No surprises! 💰
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Good news: the Site doesn't store your payment info!
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't forget! 🗓️
- **14-day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Each user gets one refund shot. Beyond 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless required by law. Fair's fair! 💸

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please, no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or commercial use! 🚫
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal, folks!
- For commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site for authorization. We're happy to chat! 🤝

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice! 🙅‍♂️
- **Don't** use technical means to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-only content. That's a big no-no! 🛡️
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up!
- The Site **won't be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server issues, or third-party service interruptions. Stuff happens! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is for general reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). We're not pros in that sense! 🤓
- The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using the Site's content or services. Just a heads up, folks!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Keep it legal! ⚖️
- Any disputes arising out of or related to these terms should first be resolved amicably through negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first! 🧑‍⚖️
