# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereafter known as “**the Site**” or “**we**”). Hey there! Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you’re essentially saying ‘Yep, I agree!’ to these terms. ✨

## 1. A Quick Intro to Our Services
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions – and more! Heads up: some of this awesome content is exclusively for our subscribed members. 🔒

## 2. User Registration & Your Account
- To register an account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- Your account is your responsibility. You're accountable for its security and everything that happens under it. Oh, and **absolutely no** transferring or sharing your account with others! 🙅‍♀️
- The Site reserves the right to **pause or even permanently close down** your account if you ever break these terms. Just sayin'. 🚨

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services operate on a monthly/annual billing cycle. You'll see the exact costs laid out clearly on the checkout page. 💰
- All payments are processed securely via third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't sweat it – the Site doesn't store any of your payment info. 🛡️
- Heads up: your subscription will **auto-renew**! 🔄 Unless you cancel it before your current billing period ends, that is.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: For all you first-time subscribers, if you're not totally jazzed with what you get within 14 days of your purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email listed at the end of these terms and tell us what went wrong. Quick note: each user gets one shot at this refund, so make it count! 🎯 After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely insists otherwise. No take-backsies then! 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content on the Site is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. You absolutely cannot copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. That's a big no-no! 🚫
- As a user, you only get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** to our content, just for your personal learning and reading enjoyment. Keep it to yourself, alright? 😉
- Need to use our stuff for commercial purposes or quote a lot of it? Just reach out to us for permission. We're usually pretty cool about it! 👍

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It’s **strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread anything illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or infringing on anyone else’s rights. Let’s keep it positive, folks! 🚫
- And it’s also a big no-no to use technical tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack open our member-only content. Seriously, don’t do it! 💻🙅‍♂️
- The Site can totally remove any questionable content and **kick out users** who aren’t playing by the rules. Consider yourself warned! 🚪

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even completely stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls! 🚀
- The Site **won't be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily unavailable because of things like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Sometimes, stuff just happens beyond our control! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information we provide on the Site is strictly for reference only. It **does not count as** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so please don't take it as such! 🙏
- The Site **is absolutely not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face because of using the Site's content or services. Use your best judgment, always! 🧠

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, without getting bogged down in conflict of law principles.
- Got a beef related to these terms? We should totally try to sort it out friendly-style first! But if we can't hug it out, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California, who have the proper jurisdiction. Fair enough? ⚖️
