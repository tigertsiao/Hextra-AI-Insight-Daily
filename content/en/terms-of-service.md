# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday**! 👋 (We'll call it "**This Site**" or "**We**" from now on). Before you jump in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using This Site, you're essentially giving us a big "Yep, I agree to these terms!" 👍

## 1. About Our Services
**This Site** offers users paid subscription content and member services. This cool stuff includes (but isn't limited to!) blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interactions. Just a heads-up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers! ✨

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy! 😉
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and *all* activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account**, folks! 🚫
- **This Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** any user's account if they happen to violate these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and the exact fees will be clearly shown on the checkout page. No surprises! 💸
- **All payments** are securely processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **This Site** *never* stores your payment info! Your privacy is key. 🔒
- **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Keep an eye on those dates! 👀
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and (gasp!) not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just reach out to us via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're seeking a refund. Each user gets this refund opportunity only once! After those 14 days, or if it's not your very first subscription, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand. Sorry, not sorry! 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by This Site (hubtoday)**. Period. Please, no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or commercial use. Let's respect creativity! 🙏
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** the content for personal learning and reading. It's for you, not for resale! 📚
- **For commercial use or extensive citations**, please hit us up to get authorization from This Site. We're usually pretty friendly! 📧

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It's strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread *any* content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice! 🛑
- **Also forbidden** is using technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content. Seriously, don't even think about it. 🧐
- **This Site** has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any violating users**. Consider this your heads-up! 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Think of it as evolving! 🚀
- **This Site** **will not be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by This Site** is purely for reference and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical advice). Always consult a pro for that! 🧑‍💻
- **This Site** **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using This Site's content or services. Use your best judgment, always! 🤔

## 8. Governing Law
**These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. For **any disputes** arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and resolve them through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't quite work out, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil! 🤝
