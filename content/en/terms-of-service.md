# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll just call "**the Site**" or "**we**" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to really dig into these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
The Site offers users premium paid subscription content and membership services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction, to name a few! Heads up: some content is only for our awesome subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration and Accounts
*   To sign up for a user account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
*   Your account's security and all activities under it are *your* responsibility! Absolutely **no transferring or sharing** your account, please.
*   If you ever break these terms, the Site totally reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just a heads up!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Paid subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with all fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
*   All your payments go through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe and PayPal), so don't sweat it – we never store your payment info. 🛡️
*   Your subscription will **auto-renew**, period, unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and aren't happy with the service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're looking for a refund. Each user gets this one-time refund opportunity. Beyond 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, payments are generally **non-refundable** unless required by law.

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
*   All original content **belongs to the Site (hubtoday)**, and you cannot copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization.
*   Users are granted a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading only.
*   For commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site to get permission.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   It's a big fat **NO** to uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights.
*   Also, **don't** try to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-only content using any tech tricks.
*   The Site can totally remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. 🚫

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any or all services at any time, without giving you a heads-up.
*   If content temporarily becomes unavailable due to force majeure, server issues, or third-party service interruptions, the Site will **not be liable for compensation**. Sorry, folks!

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The info provided by the Site is just for your general reference, and it **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.).
*   The Site is absolutely **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should first try to resolve them through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't pan out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California.
