### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Pika** is stepping up its game, moving beyond just videos to ✨ create "AI Selves" — essentially, a "second you." Users can simply upload a selfie and record some audio, and a [Digital Twin Born Instantly (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-02-21-4) is generated. This digital self boasts incredible **long-term memory and personality**, so much so that you can even set it to have a peanut allergy! 🥜 It can post for you, make calls, and stay active across various platforms. Currently, this cool feature is invite-only, so you'll need a code to experience it.

2.  **Replit** has announced a major upgrade to its Design Mode. 🚀 It's been completely overhauled, now powered by **Gemini 3.1** underneath. The result? [Sharper Visuals, Smarter Layouts (AI News)](https://x.com/Replit/status/2024908080920887802). The official word is it "has better taste now." 😉 Front-end developers are in for a significantly enhanced experience.

3.  The **Qwen3-Coder-Next API** has officially launched on Alibaba Cloud, following the open-sourcing of Qwen3-Coder-Next by Alibaba Tongyi Qianwen. You can find the [API Now Live on Alibaba Cloud (AI News)](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2024877243072147689). It's also integrated into the **Coding Plan** solution. Development teams can now flexibly call the API, making it perfect for scenarios requiring scalable endpoints. The official team is super keen on feedback! 👍

4.  **Claude Code Desktop** by Anthropic just dropped four major updates! 🚀 First up, there's a new **server preview** feature, letting you check out your work directly within the interface. They've also added local code review, so you can [Get Inline Suggestions Before Push (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2025018483210440984). Plus, PR monitoring now supports auto-fix and auto-merge. And for ultimate convenience, your sessions can move across devices – think seamless switching from CLI to desktop to mobile. How cool is that? ✨

### Frontier Research

1.  **S2Q** is making waves in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Typically, **value decomposition** methods often get stuck in sub-optimal strategies. But a new paper introduces Successive Sub-value Q-learning, which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain high-value alternative actions. Its Softmax behavior policy encourages continuous exploration, helping agents to [Quickly Adapting to Changing Optimal Solutions (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17062). Experiments have shown that S2Q significantly outperforms benchmarks across the board. 🏆

2.  **MolmoSpaces** has built a massive robotics benchmark ecosystem. 🤖 The new paper unveils over **230,000 indoor environments** and 130,000 annotated object assets. It supports various simulators like MuJoCo and Isaac, [Covering All Navigation and Manipulation Tasks (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11337). What's really impressive is the simulation-to-reality correlation, hitting a high **R=0.96**! This provides a truly scalable data and training foundation for robotics learning research.

3.  **M-Attack-V2** is a game-changer for black-box attacks on large vision-language models. Facing the challenge of attacking these models in a black-box setting, researchers introduced multi-crop alignment and auxiliary target alignment strategies. This led to a massive jump in attack success rates on Claude-4.0, from 8% to a whopping **30%**, and for [GPT-5 Reaching 100% (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645)! The method sports a modular design, allowing for flexible layering. Plus, the code is open-source! 🔓

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Taalas**, founded by a dream team of former AMD executives, is taking on Nvidia with its new **HC1 chip**. 🔥 This bad boy boasts a peak inference speed of 17,000 tokens per second. That's a mind-blowing **10 times faster** than Cerebras, and it [Costs Only One-Twentieth (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/02/381552.html)! The core idea is to etch models directly onto the silicon, making the chip the model itself. However, this hard-coding approach has sparked controversy over potential obsolescence, with netizens' opinions being quite polarized. 🤷‍♀️

2.  **Karpathy** has stirred up a debate with his "Claw" concept: **resident, schedulable AI agents** designed for long-term operation, triggered by plans or events. The community is fiercely debating: Is it really safe to hand over your passwords to a Claw? 😬 [Container Sandbox Cannot Fundamentally Eliminate Risks (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47099160). Self-hosting is seen as a viable but high-cost solution. Even the naming and commercialization have drawn some cultural snark.

3.  **Anthropic Opus 4.6** is sparking controversy over its vulnerability detection. Anthropic claims Opus 4.6 discovered around **500 high-severity vulnerabilities**, vastly outdoing Google BigSleep's 20. The community is questioning the false positive rate and the definition of "high-severity," [Demanding Disclosure of Cost/Vuln Confusion Matrix (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47091469). Some even worry that low-barrier scanning could be abused to unearth open-source zero-days. Nevertheless, the virtual security engineer path seems to be gaining practical consensus. 🛡️

4.  The proliferation of **AI side projects** is causing the community to reflect. "Just write a prompt and get on Show HN" has become the new normal, with tons of low-effort AI projects drowning out quality work. [Community Calls for Adjusting Curation Mechanisms (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47094637), with some suggesting a requirement to showcase **effort and technical details**. However, others argue that AI lowers the barrier, empowering more people to build projects. Still, architectural risks and cognitive debt are not to be ignored. 🤔

5.  **AI prediction markets** are stirring up ethical debates concerning insider trading. Some folks are using AI on Polymarket to identify insider trading and bag some alpha. Supporters argue that insider bets can boost prediction accuracy, but [Opponents Frankly State Bribery for Information is Illegal (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47091557). While on-chain transactions are traceable, the advantage of copy trading can easily be wiped out by competition. Let's be real, most regular users are just in it for the thrill of gambling. 🎲

6.  **Big Tech AI products** are facing a harsh reality: rapid user churn after massive investments. One big tech company reportedly poured billions into training models, marketing, and handing out red packets. On Lunar New Year's Eve, user numbers hit a **historic peak**. Sadly, half of them vanished the next day, and another half the day after that. 📉 [Short-Term Gain Driven, Others Take Over the Mess (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/699951ba60141db294585cb0). This has sparked deep reflection across the industry on the importance of long-term retention.

7.  The truth about **AI customer service** is that satisfaction rates are actually dropping. Many companies have rolled out AI customer service, only to find that [Customers Feel They Are Being Brushed Off (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2025003573004681524). The smart move? Keep human agents on the front lines, with AI as their behind-the-scenes assistant. Customers don't just need **professional answers**; they need emotional support too. AI should be a tool for human customer service, not a replacement. 🗣️

The flow state induced by AI programming is just too powerful. Their attention got redirected, but thankfully, they eventually made the post. Phew! 😅

4.  **Remotion** is liberating content creators by generating videos with just a single sentence! Blogger Huang Yun demonstrated how it works: you can create a video using Remotion just by typing a sentence. Back in the day, they'd spend ages hunting for material, often getting stuck in a "three days fishing, two days drying nets" cycle. 🎣 Now, [AI Now Handles 10 Pending Posts in Minutes (AI News)](https://x.com/huangyun_122/status/2025139650671902820)!

You get assistants who might earn 5K a month and also "god-tier" experts making 50K. 💸 The possibilities for pay-per-use outsourcing are endless!

6.  **Xiaohongshu Diandian** is making its breakthrough with a "strategy guide" mode. Blogger rosicky analyzes that data importance is being **re-prioritized**. Xiaohongshu Diandian chose "Strategy Mode" as its core feature, [Based on Community UGC Real Long-Tail Data (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/69993dd3c5a1d4e649bfa774). Real-world tests of its Hokkaido ski guide showed impressive results. ⛷️ There's huge potential for expansion in the lifestyle services sector!
