### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Tsinghua and Peking University just dropped a new benchmark that proves strong vision doesn't equal real capability!** Their WorldArena is shattering the ["quality-only" theory (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-02-13-7), instead focusing on real-world physics compliance 🌍. Robots gotta understand physics, not just churn out pretty videos 🎥. Functional intelligence is just getting started, and this is basically the **driver's license test** for embodied AI. You could ace the vision part and still flunk the whole mission 💡.

2.  **Autonomous driving multimodal large models are getting a slim-down solution with the new SToRM framework!** This bad boy enables [efficient token reduction (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11656), slashing computation costs by a whopping 30 times 📉. It keeps full token performance while still nailing human instruction interaction 💡. By using sliding window prediction, it precisely hangs onto **key information**. This framework is totally clearing the path for vehicle-side deployment 🧹.

3.  **Turns out, context files for code agents might actually be shooting themselves in the foot!** New research reveals that [AGENTS.md (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988) can actually *decrease* task success rates ❌. All those redundant requirements just jack up costs and leave the models totally baffled 🤯. Experts are saying: humans should only provide the **absolute minimum requirements**. These files should only contain the core logic 🔧.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Anthropic just locked in a mind-blowing $30 billion funding round!** Their valuation has absolutely skyrocketed to $380 billion, with Claude Code becoming their undisputed [revenue engine (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2022138692991885716).
